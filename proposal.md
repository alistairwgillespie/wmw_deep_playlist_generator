### Domain Background
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

Recommendation Systems (RS) have become a ubiquitous tool for enhancing user experiences across the Internet since the mid-1990s. However, recommendations have been an element of evolution since our ancient counterparts walked the earth. Whether it be the religion we worship, what crop to cultivate, or where to migrate during the colder seasons, people often relied on advice from their peers before making decisions (Sharma, Singh, 2016).

Spotify is a leading incumbent of the music streaming industry boasting the greatest market share of all of it's competitors. It's army of engineers and data scientists have deployed recommendation functionality in playlists, auto

In recent times, a broad variety of such systems have come to exist across a number of domains including social media, advertising, e-commerce and media streaming. In general terms, these tools anaslyze the behaviour of users over a period of time, in the form of clicks, plays or views. Some systems will even analyze the infinitesimal movements of a user's cursor to gain the insights it needs. Algorithms then formalize any meaningful patterns to provide recommendations to the end-user with the goal of (i) increasing engagement (ii) optimizing the user experience (iii) and in most cases increasing revenue. 

- History of recommendation systems (Tick)
- Media
- How do they work
- Why
- Related academic research 

In this section, provide brief details on the background information of the domain from which the project is proposed. Historical information relevant to the project should be included. It should be clear how or why a problem in the domain can or should be solved. Related academic research should be appropriately cited in this section, including why that research is relevant. Additionally, a discussion of your personal motivation for investigating a particular problem in the domain is encouraged but not required.

### Problem Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe the problem that is to be solved. The problem described should be well defined and should have at least one relevant potential solution. Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

In recent years, Spotify has arguably encountered it's greatest competition in its short history, in the likes of Apple Music, Amazon and Tencent Music. To thrive in this streaming climate, Spotify not only needs to harness the big data at its disposal but also empower its user community to contribute in new and innovative ways. Here

### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

In this section, the dataset(s) and/or input(s) being considered for the project should be thoroughly described, such as how they relate to the problem and why they should be used. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.

### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.
